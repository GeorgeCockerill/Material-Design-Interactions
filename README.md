# Material-Design-Interactions
A Framer.JS and Framer Studio library of standard Google Material Design interactions

The interactions should be defined in the materialInteractions.coffee module.

The Framer app.coffee file is used purely for showcasing the interactions. It should not contain the definition of any of the interactions.
